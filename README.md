# AESAT
An optimization framework for SAT solvers based on LLM

The design of our framework aims to break through the bottlenecks of manual algorithm improvement by leveraging the advantages of large models to achieve fully automated, end-to-end algorithm optimization, thereby significantly enhancing productivity.
We will open source the framework after the paper is published
